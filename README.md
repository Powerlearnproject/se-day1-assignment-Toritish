Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.Enables creation of software thet power various aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The rise of agile, methodologies
The development of programming languages
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements – Gathering user needs and user requirements.
Design – Creating a detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation – Writing code and building software according to the design.
Testing – testing to see if software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment – releasing the software to the users
Maintenance – providing repairs, updates and enhancements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall has a rigid structure in that it is hard to go back and implement a change when a phase is completed. While agile is flexible and iterative and involves high customer interaction.
Agile would be appropriate in a project where customer feedback is essential for example when creating a mobile app where the market is always changing.
Waterfall would be suitable when the requirements are clearly defined and unlikely to change. For example, creating a software to use in a medical field where documentation is used 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer writes code and implement software solutions
Quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. i.e. Visual Studio 
Version Control Systems used for tracking source code and coordinating work among members. i.e. Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight deadline
Some strategies to overcome are:
Effective communication
Agile methodologies


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing a single component
Integration is testing how the different components work together
System testing is testing the software as a whole
Acceptance testing is testing if the software meets the users’ requirements 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions to get the best responses from AI models.
AI gets to understand exactly what you need since the questions are clear and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague – “Tell me about space”
Improved – “Explain the formation of stars process the role of gas clouds and gravity”
The improved is more effective since its clearer it has narrowed down the expectations of the questions to a specific prompt
